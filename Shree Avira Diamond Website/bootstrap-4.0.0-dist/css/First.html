        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Oval cut diamonds are simply an elongated round brilliant cut, but the appeal of these loose diamonds goes much deeper. Oval cuts have the brilliance of the round diamond, but a more unique shape. They are a fashionable and trendy diamond cut that, when cut well, can look larger than a round diamond. But many people love this diamond shape for another of its benefits: Oval diamonds can make one’s fingers look thinner and longer, and it compliments a wide range of hand shapes and sizes.

            Although this shape is a more recent cut, invented in the mid 1900s, it has already proven to be a lasting and beloved style. This cut is intended to represent the longevity of your relationship, which might explain the popularity of oval cut diamond rings. But though you might love its symbolic meaning, it requires certain considerations when you're selecting a loose diamond.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Round Shape Diamond</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> Round diamonds are traditionally the first and most popular diamond that’s given as a symbol of commitment. They have a classic uniform and symmetrical shape that consists of 58 facets, which qualifies them a brilliant cut. The faceting on round cut diamonds also makes color and inclusions appear better than in other fancy shapes. In fact, these stones are so beloved that over 50% of all diamonds purchased are round cuts -- you probably can't look around without seeing a round diamond engagement ring. But what do you need to know if you're thinking of buying a loose diamond in this shape? We break it all down, from setting choices to ideal measurements, what you should expect to pay, and more.
